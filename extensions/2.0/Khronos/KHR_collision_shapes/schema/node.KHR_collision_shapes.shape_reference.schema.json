When true, the referenced shape **MUST** be a mesh type, which **MUST** use the same number of morph targets as the node which this object is attached to. Note, the mesh referenced by the shape **MAY** differ from the mesh referenced by the node, provided they have the same number of morph targets; this allows collision shapes to use simplified geometry.",
