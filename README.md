# MSFT\_RigidBodies

This repository contains two proposed glTF extenions:

## MSFT_CollisionPrimitives

Allows a document to specify primitive geometric types, suitable for real-time collision detection.
[MSFT_CollisionPrimitives documentation](CollisionPrimitives)

## MSFT_RigidBodies

Adds properties to nodes, enabling them to participate in a rigid body physics simulation.
[MSFT_RigidBodies documentation](RigidBodies)

## Known Implementations

Work in progress. Will be kept up-to-date with revisions of specification
